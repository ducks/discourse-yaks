## ðŸš§ In Progress

### Phase 3: Implement Remaining Features

**Priority: High** - These are defined but not yet implemented.

#### Post Pinning (within topics)
- [ ] Implement pin logic in YakFeatureService.apply_feature_effects
- [ ] Add CSS styling for pinned posts
- [ ] Post-level pinning logic (show at top of topic)
- [ ] 24-hour expiration handling
- [ ] Test pinning behavior

#### Post Boost
- [ ] Implement boost logic in YakFeatureService.apply_feature_effects
- [ ] Add CSS styling for boosted posts
- [ ] Integrate with feed/search ranking (if applicable)
- [ ] 72-hour expiration handling
- [ ] Test boost behavior

#### Custom User Flair
- [ ] Implement flair logic (different from post features)
- [ ] User-level custom field storage
- [ ] Flair display in user card/profile
- [ ] Text length validation (max 20 chars)
- [ ] 30-day expiration handling
- [ ] Color selection for flair
- [ ] Test flair display across site

---

## Phase 4: Earning System

**Priority: Medium** - Users currently can only get Yaks from admin grants or
purchases. Need automatic earning for organic engagement.

### Design Decisions Needed
- [ ] Define earning rates (how many Yaks per action?)
  - [ ] Yaks per post created (if any)
  - [ ] Yaks per like received (progressive: 5 likes = 10 Yaks, 10 likes = 25?)
  - [ ] Yaks per minute reading (if tracking)
  - [ ] Daily login bonus?

### Anti-Gaming Measures
- [ ] Rate limiting per user per day
- [ ] Diminishing returns for repetitive actions
- [ ] Quality thresholds (minimum post length, etc.)
- [ ] Flag/delete post deducts Yaks

### Implementation
- [ ] Background job for auto-earning
  - [ ] Scheduled job (every 5 minutes? hourly?)
  - [ ] Process posts that hit like thresholds
  - [ ] Batch updates for performance
  - [ ] Logging and monitoring
- [ ] Like-based rewards (uses existing `yaks_min_likes_for_reward` setting)
  - [ ] Award Yaks when post reaches threshold
  - [ ] Progressive rewards system
  - [ ] Cap per post (`yaks_max_reward_per_post`)

### Testing
- [ ] Test earning from posts
- [ ] Test earning from likes
- [ ] Test rate limiting
- [ ] Test reward caps
- [ ] Test background job performance

## Phase 5: Feature Expiration & Cleanup

**Priority: Medium** - Features with durations need automatic cleanup.

- [x] Background job to expire features (ExpireYakFeature - 20251011)
  - [x] Query YakFeatureUse.expired
  - [x] Call YakFeatureService.remove_feature_effects
  - [x] Job scheduled at expiration time via Jobs.enqueue_at
- [x] Test expiration for topic pins (24h)
- [ ] Test expiration for pinned posts (24h) - once implemented
- [ ] Test expiration for boosted posts (72h) - once implemented
- [ ] Test expiration for custom flair (30 days) - once implemented
- [ ] Notifications before expiration? (optional)

---

## Phase 6: Authorization & Security

**Priority: Medium-High** - Currently no permission checks.

### Guardian Implementation
- [ ] Create `lib/guardian/yak_guardian.rb` (or extend existing Guardian)
- [ ] can_spend_yaks? - check user owns wallet
- [ ] can_apply_feature_to_post? - check ownership or permissions
- [ ] can_view_wallet? - privacy settings
- [ ] can_gift_yaks? - if implementing gifting

### Security Audit
- [ ] Rate limiting on spending endpoints
- [ ] Validate all user inputs
- [ ] CSRF protection verified
- [ ] SQL injection prevention audit
- [ ] Test concurrent spending (race conditions)

---

## Phase 7: Admin Dashboard Improvements

**Priority: Low** - Basic admin endpoints exist but UI is minimal.

## Current Focus (2025-10-12)

**Recently Completed:**
- âœ… Topic pinning feature (100 Yaks, 24h duration)
- âœ… Feature expiration system with background jobs
- âœ… Modular service architecture (posts + topics)
- âœ… Reactive balance display in user menu

**Immediate Next Steps:**
1. Implement post pinning effect (pin to top of topic, not category)
2. Implement post boost effect (visual indicator + ranking if applicable)
3. Implement custom flair (user-level feature)
4. Write blog post Part 2 about implementing topic pinning

**Blockers:** None

**Notes:**
- Backend and frontend infrastructure is solid and proven
- Service layer is truly modular with keyword arguments
- Expiration system working with real scheduled jobs
- All the hard patterns are established
- Now it's about adding more feature effects and polishing
- Earning system is important but not blocking users from trying the system
