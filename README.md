# Discourse Yaks - Virtual Currency System

A virtual currency system for Discourse forums that allows users to earn and spend "Yaks" on premium features. The name is a playful pun on "yakking" (talking/chatting) and "yak shaving" (developer rabbit holes).

## Features

### Core Wallet System
- **Balance Tracking**: Each user has a wallet with current balance and lifetime statistics
- **Transaction History**: Complete audit trail of all Yak transactions
- **Multiple Transaction Types**: Purchase, earn, spend, refund, and admin grants

### Available Features (Proof of Concept)
1. **Post Highlighting** (25 Yaks) - Add a colored border and background to posts
2. **Post Pinning** (50 Yaks) - Pin posts to the top of topics for 24 hours
3. **Custom User Flair** (100 Yaks) - Display custom flair for 30 days
4. **Post Boost** (30 Yaks) - Priority in feeds and search for 72 hours

### Admin Tools
- System-wide statistics dashboard
- Grant Yaks to users
- View transaction history with filtering
- Create and manage custom features
- Full audit logging

## Installation

1. Add the plugin to your `app.yml`:

```yaml
hooks:
  after_code:
    - exec:
        cd: $home/plugins
        cmd:
          - git clone https://github.com/discourse/discourse-yaks.git
```

2. Rebuild your container:

```bash
./launcher rebuild app
```

3. Enable the plugin in Admin â†’ Settings â†’ Plugins â†’ `yaks_enabled`

4. Default features will be seeded automatically when enabled

## Current Status

### âœ… Implemented
- Core wallet and transaction system
- Database schema and migrations
- All models with full test coverage
- YakFeatureService for applying features
- Basic controllers (user and admin)
- Site settings configuration
- CSS styling for features
- Post highlighting proof of concept

### ðŸš§ Next Steps
1. **Frontend Components**
   - Ember.js balance display component
   - Spend Yaks button on posts
   - Full wallet page UI
   - Feature purchase modals

2. **Payment Integration**
   - Replace stub with real Stripe integration
   - Webhook handlers for payment confirmation
   - Refund processing

3. **Earning System**
   - Background job for quality post detection
   - Automatic Yak rewards based on likes
   - Milestone rewards

4. **Feature Enhancements**
   - Custom user flair implementation
   - Post boost ranking algorithm
   - Expiration cleanup background job

5. **Testing**
   - Controller request specs
   - System specs for UI interactions
   - Integration tests for full feature flows

## Security Considerations

- All spending actions require authentication
- Transaction atomicity ensures balance consistency
- Rate limiting on spending (to be implemented)
- Admin actions logged via StaffActionLogger
- Input validation on all endpoints

## Performance

- Denormalized `users.yak_balance` for fast lookups
- Indexed foreign keys on all relations
- JSONB for flexible feature_data storage
- Efficient scopes for common queries
